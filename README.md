## catering your education to your needs!  

This repository contains the code for my Insight Data Science project.

### Introduction:  

edu-cater is a tool for custom course recommendations on Coursera. Course recommendations are often based on courses with highly similar content, but students may wish to select courses that are *somewhat* related to a skillset that they already possess, while also learning a new set of skills. This is where edu-cater comes in.  
 
Using topic modeling, users can get an understanding of specific course topics that are not only based on general topics and skills, but also other features from the syllabus and student reviews of the course. Course length and difficulty are also factors that can be considered when making course requests.

Users can make requests for features that they would like to see in the recommended courses. Then, an optimization algorithm selects the courses that best match the user's criteria.
  
### Setup and installation:  

Run the following code to set up edu-cater:

`cd edu-cater`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
`python setup.py`
